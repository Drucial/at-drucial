          In a world cluttered with complexity, simplicity stands out.
          &quot;Less is more&quot; is not just a mantra; it&apos;s a disciplined
          approach to design and life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elegance in design lies in its restraint. Every element has a purpose,
          every feature is thoughtfully crafted, and nothing is superfluous.
